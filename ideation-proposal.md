## Authors

## Problem Statement

Modern web users frequently keep numerous, cluttered tabs open for long periods, possibly to revisit later. Yet, managing these tabs and recalling to review or close them can be overwhelming. They not only consume memory on the PC but also reduce work efficiency. Currently, there's a shortage of effective tools designed for tab organization and for prompting users to address long-neglected, unused tabs.

## Target Audience

- Professionals who research or work with multiple web resources simultaneously
- Students who open multiple tabs for study materials and research papers
- Anyone who tends to keep tabs open for extended periods, planning to revisit them later

## Description

TabsOFF is a Chrome Extension that intelligently organizes open tabs by time/days unused, helping users reduce clutter and navigate between them efficiently. Additionally, it features a unique reminder system that notifies users to review tabs that have been open and unused for more than a day, encouraging a cleaner, more organized browsing experience.

## Selling Points

1. Provides categorization of tabs based on how long theyâ€™ve been opened.
2. Reminds users to review tabs that have been open but unused for over a day, helping reduce clutter and improve browser performance.
3. Offers a sleek, user-friendly interface for managing and organizing tabs, with customizable categories and reminders.
4. Saves memory and improves browser performance by encouraging the closure of unnecessary tabs.
5. Enhances productivity and focus by minimizing distractions from excessive, unused tabs.

## User Stories

3. As an online shopper who opens many product tabs, I want to be notified to revisit or close these tabs after a certain period, helping me make purchasing decisions faster and keeping my browser organized.

5. As an academic researcher, I often open tabs related to various research papers and resources. I want TabsOFF to automatically save the URLs of long-unused tabs to a specified document before closing them, ensuring I don't lose important references.
6. As a user concerned with privacy, I want TabsOFF to offer a feature that automatically closes tabs containing sensitive information if they've been left unattended for a certain period, helping me safeguard my personal data.

11. As an individual conscious about browser performance, I want TabsOFF to provide statistics on how many tabs were closed and how much memory was freed up weekly, motivating me to maintain a cleaner browser environment.
12. As a project manager constantly juggling tasks, I need TabsOFF to only remind me about non-essential tabs during my scheduled review times, so I can focus on critical work without distraction but still declutter my workspace at designated times.
13. As a user concerned about losing track of important tabs, I want the option to set specific tabs as "Do Not Close," allowing me to keep essential tabs open indefinitely without them being automatically closed by TabsOFF.
14. As someone who uses the browser for leisure reading, I'd like TabsOFF to suggest closing tabs related to articles or blogs if they've been open for more than a few days, helping me manage my leisure time more effectively.

Ani: API

Brian: testing and integration

Chenxi: UI

Boya: storage

We meet in person at least once a week to work together and we will be experimenting and researching on our own time. We will use Slack to communicate and use GitHub to share code. Task management will be handled through Kanban. 

### Risks and Mitigation
Risk 1: Incompatibility with future browser updates.

Mitigation 1: Continuous integration and testing with the latest browser versions.

Risk 2: Low user adoption due to privacy concerns.

Mitigation 2: Transparent privacy policy and optional data collection features.


### Milestones and Timeline
Week 1: Set up the project repository, define the initial project structure, and start on basic UI components.

Week 2: Develop core functionalities for tab management and reminders. Implement data storage solutions.

Week 3: Polish UI/UX, integrate with the Chrome API, and begin internal testing.

Week 4: Finalize features, conduct beta testing, and prepare for launch.
